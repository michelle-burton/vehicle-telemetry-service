# 🚗 Vehicle Telemetry Service

A serverless microservice for ingesting and retrieving vehicle telemetry data, built using **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, and **Terraform**, with in-memory data storage.

This project demonstrates reusable AWS cloud components, infrastructure-as-code (IaC) principles, and scalable design patterns for microservices. It was built to showcase cloud engineering and DevOps capabilities in a modern serverless architecture.
